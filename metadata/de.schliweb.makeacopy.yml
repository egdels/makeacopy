Summary: Privacy-focused document scanner with OCR and PDF export

Description: |
  MakeACopy is an open-source document scanner app for Android that allows you to digitize paper documents with OCR functionality. The app is designed to be privacy-friendly, working completely offline without any cloud connection or tracking.

  Features:
  * Camera Scanning: Capture documents using the device camera
  * Edge Detection: Automatic document edge detection using OpenCV
  * Perspective Correction: Adjust and crop documents with manual or automatic perspective correction
  * Image Enhancement: Apply filters (grayscale, contrast, sharpening)
  * OCR: Offline text recognition with Tesseract
  * PDF Export: Save as searchable PDF with recognized text
  * Share & Save: Export locally or share with other apps
  * Dark Mode: Material 3 theme with day/night support
  * Privacy-Focused: 100% offline functionality, no internet connection required

  MakeACopy is F-Droid compliant and builds OpenCV from source during the build process, ensuring that no pre-built binaries are included in the repository. All components are open source and respect your privacy.

MaintainerNotes: |
  The OpenCV module in this repository has been pre-cleaned of all binaries to ensure F-Droid compatibility.
  The repository contains only the necessary Java files from the OpenCV Android SDK, with all binary files removed.
  
  The native libraries are built from source during the build process using the following scripts:
  1. fetch_opencv.sh - Downloads OpenCV source code from https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
  2. build_opencv_android.sh - Builds OpenCV native libraries for all architectures (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64)
  3. prepare_opencv.sh - Integrates the built native libraries into the app
  
  This approach ensures F-Droid compatibility by:
  1. Using the pre-cleaned OpenCV module for Java classes (no pre-compiled binaries in the repository)
  2. Building all native libraries from source during the build process
  
  The app does not include any pre-built binaries or non-free dependencies.
